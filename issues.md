3. Event listeners are attached twice - SOLVED // Problem was that when loaded from local storage, the cards were created without delay, meaning they got the same ID using miliseconds - SOLUTION: Math.random() * Date.now()
4. Loading the defProject twice when first loading app. - SOLVED // Created checking logic in index.js for empty localStorage and calling functions accordingly.
